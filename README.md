## Insights
The total trip duration for casual riders and annual members is affected by season. The temperature is very low during the winter season, fewer people are willing to go out and people who need to travel daily for work will choose to take other public transport, this had caused the total trip duration are the lowest among another season. 

The annual member display two peak period which is at 7 a.m and 5 p.m indicate they are most likely office workers. The casual rider peak period is 4 p.m and 5 p.m. The top 20 station visit by casual riders mostly are tourist locations, the casual riders most likely are a couple, students, retirees, tourists, and family.

Over the years, we see a significant divergence of total trip duration from May to September for two groups of users. This has shown their usage pattern significantly due to their preference and it is more clear when we look into total trip duration on every single hour within the day.

Based on the casual rider’s monthly total trips durations, the best odds to launch the new marketing campaign is between April to May. Also, consider different price strategies like seasonal passes to increase the conversion rate.
The best would be if the marketing team can run a survey to collect the data from current casual riders, understand what kind of features or benefits they look for when considering subscribe annual members.
